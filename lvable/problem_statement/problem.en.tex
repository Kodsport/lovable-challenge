\section*{Input}
The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$), the number of days as described above.

The second line contains $N$ integers, $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$, where $a_i$ denotes the water level on the $i$-th day.

\section*{Output}
Print a single integer: the maximum amount of water units the thirsy cow can drink across all $N$ days. 

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains
a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
