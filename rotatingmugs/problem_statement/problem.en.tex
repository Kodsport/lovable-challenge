\problemname{Rotating Mugs}

\illustration{0.3}{mugs.png}

At Lovables office, they have some really cool coffee mugs. 
Even though the mugs are so cool, we will model the mug as a simple object with 4 sides, `North', `West', `South', `East'.

You have $M$ mugs indexed from $0$ to $M-1$ infront of you, and you are now tasked with transforming the mugs infront of you such that the `North' side is faced towards you.
However, whoever gave you task allowed you to only do \textit{Magical Rotations}. A Magical Rotation consists of the following 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pick an integer $a$ $(0 \leq a < M)$, and another integer $b$ $(0 \leq b < M-1)$, where $a \neq b$. Note that $b$ cannot be the last index. 
  \item Switch the two mugs positioned at index $a$ and index $b$ without rotating any of them.
  \item Finish by taking the mug that was at index $a$ and the mug now to the right of it, and rotate both by $90$ degrees.
\end{enumerate}

When rotating a mug $90$ degrees, 
\begin{itemize}
  \item A mug with `North' side facing you now has its `West' side facing you.
  \item A mug with `West' side facing you now has its `South' side facing you.  
  \item A mug with `South' side facing you now has its `East' side facing you.  
  \item A mug with `East' side facing you now has its `North' side facing you.  
\end{itemize}

You wonder if it even is possible to rotate all the mugs infront of you such that the `North' side is faced towards you by only using Magiacal Rotations.
To impress whoever gave you this task, you would like to use as few Magical Rotations as possible.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains one integer $M$ ($2 \leq M \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$), the number of cups infront of you.

The second line contains a string of $M$ characters $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_M$ ($c_i \in \{`N',`W',`S',`E'\}$), the character representing the current side of the mug that is faced towards you.

\section*{Output}
Print one integer, the minimum number of Magical Rotations such that all mugs has the `North' side faced towards you. If it is impossible, print $-1$. 

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains
a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.

  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Points} & \textbf{Constraints} \\ \hline
  $1$    & $15$       & From the start, all mugs either have their `North' or `East' side facing you. \\ \hline
  $2$    & $25$       & $M \leq 100$ \\ \hline
  $3$    & $60$       & No additional constraints. \\ \hline
